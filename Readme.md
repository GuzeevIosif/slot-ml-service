### Structure

All research notebooks can be found in the `research` folder.

`service` folder have containerized service with latest model.
All users queries are saved in the clickhouse database.

#### Service config

In order to run service, you need firstly specify your `user_token` in `service/model/model.env` file.

Use mock traffic generator for testing purposes: set `TRAFFIC_URL=http://mock_query_generator:5000/`.
